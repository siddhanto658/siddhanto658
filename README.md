# Hi, I'm Siddhanto 👋

**Cloud Security Engineer | DevSecOps | AWS Solutions Architect**

"Builder-Breaker" - you can't secure what you can't build.

---

### What I Do
I help companies **build faster** and **stay secure** at the same time. Instead of fixing security problems after they're deployed, I build security into systems from day one - saving time, money, and preventing data breaches.
