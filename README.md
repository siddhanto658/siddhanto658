# Hi, I'm Siddhanto 👋

**Cloud Security Engineer | DevSecOps | AWS Solutions Architect**

I am a "Builder-Breaker" who believes that you cannot secure a system you do not understand how to build. I specialize in designing highly scalable cloud infrastructure and securing it through automated, shift-left methodologies. 

### 🛡️ How I Help Companies
I bridge the gap between development and security. Instead of just finding vulnerabilities after deployment, I help organizations:
* **Architect Zero-Trust Environments:** Enforcing strict Least-Privilege IAM and role-based access control (RBAC) across multi-account AWS architectures.
* **Implement Shift-Left Security:** Integrating automated security scanning and compliance checks directly into developer CI/CD pipelines.
* **Automate Threat Remediation:** Writing Python scripts to automatically detect, isolate, and remediate cloud misconfigurations before they can be exploited.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 1. [Zero-Trust Cross-Account IAM Architecture](https://github.com/siddhanto658/Cloud_secure_IAM.git)
* **What it does:** A multi-account AWS environment utilizing STS (Security Token Service) to eliminate hardcoded credentials and static IAM users.
* **Tech Stack:** AWS IAM, AWS STS, AWS CLI, JSON
* **Business Value:** Prevents privilege escalation and lateral movement by enforcing strict `AssumeRole` trust policies, allowing centralized security auditing without compromising production environments.

#### 2. [Network Asset Discovery & Threat Mapping Engine](Link-to-repo)
* **What it does:** An automated Python tool that scans local networks to map active devices, identify open ports, and resolve MAC addresses to device manufacturers.
* **Tech Stack:** Python (Scapy, Socket), Networking (TCP/IP, ARP)
* **Business Value:** Provides real-time visibility into "shadow IT" and unmanaged assets, a critical first step in protecting enterprise network perimeters.
