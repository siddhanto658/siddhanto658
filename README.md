# Hi, I'm Siddhanto 👋

**Cloud Security Engineer | DevSecOps | AWS Solutions Architect**

I am a "Builder-Breaker" who believes that you cannot secure a system you do not understand how to build. I specialize in designing highly scalable cloud infrastructure and securing it through automated, shift-left methodologies. 

### 🛡️ How I Help Companies
I bridge the gap between development and security. Instead of just finding vulnerabilities after deployment, I help organizations:
* **Architect Zero-Trust Environments:** Enforcing strict Least-Privilege IAM and role-based access control (RBAC) across multi-account AWS architectures.
* **Implement Shift-Left Security:** Integrating automated security scanning and compliance checks directly into developer CI/CD pipelines.
* **Automate Threat Remediation:** Writing Python scripts to automatically detect, isolate, and remediate cloud misconfigurations before they can be exploited.
